Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 
These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand) and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). 
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

The rules are as follows:      
Rock vs Scissors: Rock wins because rock smashes scissors.      
Rock vs Paper: Paper wins because paper covers rock.        
Scissors vs Paper: Scissors win because scissors cut paper.      
Everything else is a tie.
